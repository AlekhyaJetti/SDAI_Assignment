Differences between client-server and peer-to-peer networks:
In a client-server network, there is a centralized server that provides resources or services to clients (devices) that request them. Clients depend on the server to perform tasks and access resources.

Diagram:


Clients      Server
  A          +-----+
  |          |     |
  B----->----|     |
  |          |     |
  C          +-----+
Example: A web server hosting a website and providing web pages to clients (web browsers).

In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, there is no centralized server. Instead, each node (peer) in the network can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources and services with each other.

Example: BitTorrent, a file-sharing protocol where files are distributed among peers without a central server.

Differences between non-persistent and persistent HTTP connections:
In a non-persistent HTTP connection, each request-response pair between the client and server requires a separate TCP connection. The connection is closed after each exchange, causing higher latency and resource usage.

In a persistent HTTP connection (HTTP/1.1 and later), multiple request-response pairs can be sent over a single TCP connection, reducing the overhead of establishing and closing connections for each exchange.

Difference between Stop and Wait protocol and pipelined protocol:
Stop and Wait protocol: In this protocol, the sender sends a single data packet and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next packet. This results in a lower throughput, as the sender is idle during the time it takes for the acknowledgment to return.

Pipelined protocol: In this protocol, the sender can send multiple data packets before waiting for acknowledgments, increasing throughput by better utilizing the available bandwidth.

A reliable transfer protocol being stop-and-wait means that it sends a single data packet and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next packet. It ensures reliability by retransmitting lost or corrupted packets.

To avoid ambiguity in a pipelined reliable transfer protocol with a window size of w, 2 * w sequence numbers are needed. This ensures that there is no confusion between the transmitted packets and their acknowledgments.

MSS stands for Maximum Segment Size, which is the maximum amount of data that can be carried in a single TCP segment, excluding the TCP header.

The receiver's advertised window is a value communicated by the receiver to the sender, specifying the amount of data that the receiver is willing to accept. This helps with flow control in TCP.

In the TCP state "ESTABLISHED," all data is transferred between the client and server.

a. Client-server distribution time calculation:

File size: F = 25 Gbits = 25 * 1000 Mbits
Server upload rate: ùë¢! = 30 Mbps

Minimum distribution time: F / ùë¢! = (25 * 1000 Mbits) / 30 Mbps = 833.33 seconds

b. Peer-to-peer distribution time calculation:

Total download rate of all clients: N * ùëë" = 100 * 3 Mbps = 300 Mbps
Total upload rate of all clients: N * ùë¢ = 100 * 0.4 Mbps = 40 Mbps
Total capacity: ùë¢! + N * ùë¢ = 30 Mbps + 40 Mbps = 70 Mbps

Minimum distribution time: F / min(Total capacity, Total download rate) = (25 * 1000 Mbits) / 70 Mbps = 357.14 seconds

UDP segment header with given information:

Source port: 3306
Destination port: 80
Data: 9234, 8345

Length = Header length (8 bytes) + Data length (4 bytes) = 12 bytes

Now, let's calculate the checksum. First, we need to convert the data and header fields into 16-bit binary format:

Source port (3306): 110011101010
Destination port (80): 000101000000
Length (12): 000000110000
Data1 (9234): 100100000010
Data2 (8345): 100000101001

Add these values together, ignoring the carry:

110011101010
000101000000
000000110000
100100000010
100000101001
110101101011 (sum)

Now, take the one's complement of the sum:

001010010100 (one's complement)

The checksum is: 001010010100

a. In the second segment, the sequence number would be the previous sequence number plus the number of bytes in the first segment. Thus:
Sequence number: 127 + 80 = 207
Source port number: 302
Destination port number: 80

b. If the first segment arrives before the second segment, the acknowledgment will have the following values:

ACK number: Sequence number of the first segment + number of bytes in the first segment = 127 + 80 = 207
Source port number: 80 (reversed)
Destination port number: 302 (reversed)

c. If the second segment arrives before the first segment, the acknowledgment of the first arriving segment (second segment) would have:

ACK number: 127 (since the expected byte was not received yet)

WAIT FOR CALL 0: Send packet 0, transition to WAIT FOR ACK 0.
WAIT FOR ACK 0: If ACK 0 is received and not garbled, transition to WAIT FOR CALL 1. If NAK is received or garbled ACK, resend packet 0.
WAIT FOR CALL 1: Send packet 1, transition to WAIT FOR ACK 1.
WAIT FOR ACK 1: If ACK 1 is received and not garbled, transition to WAIT FOR CALL 0. If NAK is received or garbled ACK, resend packet 1.
Receiver:

WAIT FOR 0: If packet 0 is received and not corrupted, send ACK 0, and transition to WAIT FOR 1.
WAIT FOR 1: If packet 1 is received and not corrupted, send ACK 1, and transition to WAIT FOR 0.
This is a simple description of the states and transitions for a reliable data transfer protocol with garbled ACK/NAK handling. Please create the diagram based on this information.
